# Resourcely Use Cases

This is a collection of [Resourcely](https://www.resourcely.io) Blueprints and Guardrails for a variety of use cases. 

[Blueprints](https://docs.resourcely.io/concepts/blueprints) are customizable templates used to configure and deploy infrastructure. With Blueprints, combine expert guidance with an automatically generated, rich UI. Developers follow fill out a guided form to configure infrastructure, and Terraform that meets your companyâ€™s expectations is generated and submitted via your preferred change management processes.

[Guardrails](https://docs.resourcely.io/concepts/guardrails) are policies built for infrastructure, embedded into your developer workflows. With Guardrails, define rules that are enforced as part of your existing CI pipeline. Build custom workflows, take into account context, and route Terraform that violates your Guardrails for approval. Finally, give developers feedback and context when they are making configuration decisions instead of after by integrating Guardrails with Blueprints.

In order to use these objects, you must sign up for a free Resourcely account at https://portal.resourcely.io. Follow the [Quickstart](https://docs.resourcely.io/get-started/quickstart) to integrate into your existing Terraform runner (or follow our scaffolding repo to create one for free with GitHub Actions) and change management tooling.
