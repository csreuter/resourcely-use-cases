# Encryption

In this folder are Blueprints and Guardrails that demonstrate how to encrypt GCP resources by default using Resourcely.


- Crypto keys and key rings
- Compute Instances
- Blob Storage
- Pub/Sub Topics
- Cloud SQL
- BigQuery
- Cloud Functions

These are basic examples with a focus on enforcing encryption. Make sure to follow along with the blog (coming soon) and [tutorial](https://docs.resourcely.io/build/using-resourcely/use-cases/encryption-for-gcp)!
